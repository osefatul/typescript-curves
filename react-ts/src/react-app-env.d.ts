/// <reference types="react-scripts" />

/*
The line /// <reference types="react-scripts" /> is a reference to the type definitions for the react-scripts package. This allows the TypeScript compiler to understand the types used in the package and provide better type checking and code completion for developers using the package in their project. It is commonly found at the top of .ts or .tsx files in a project that was created with create-react-app, which uses react-scripts as a development dependency
